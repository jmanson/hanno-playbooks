# Diversity

We believe that diversity is an essential part of building a great company

We're currently drafting a formal diversity policy to make clear our commitments on diversity. We'll update this page as it progresses.

Statistics for our [current team](https://hanno.co/team/) (including all regular contributors and freelancers) are as follows:

- 10 regular shipmates and contributors
- 80% white, 20% non-white
- 80% male, 20% female

There are of course many more data points we can track to monitor diversity. We'll be updating this list soon with those which we feel are relevant.

We've [written about the topic of diversity on our blog in more detail](https://logbook.hanno.co/improve-gender-diversity/).
