# Security

Protecting data for ourselves and our clients

Running your entire business online means you need to be more careful than usual about security.

## VPNs
We used to maintain our own VPNs, but found that the maintenance hassle wasn't worthwhile. We now have a [GetCloak](https://www.getcloak.com/) account and create profiles for all shipmates.

If you are not working from a trusted, home WiFi we ask that you switch on Cloak so that you'll automatically connect to a secure VPN and protect your connection.

## More security guidelines coming soon...
Our security does go further than this. We'll add more notes and guidelines soon.
