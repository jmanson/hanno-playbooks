# Team Retreats

Getting the whole team together in one place!

Periodically, our whole core team gets together for team trips. We take care of finding accommodation and paying all travel expenses for employees to get there.

Since we rarely see each other face-to-face, these trips are a really important way for us to spend time together and learn how to grow and improve.

## Selecting a destination
The destination for each trip is put to a team vote a few months before we depart.

## Trip format
We've experimented with many trip lengths (from 1 week to 6 weeks) and itineraries (from training workshops to surf retreats).

Our current team trip format is for most of the team to join for 10 days including 2 weekends, with a 'core'/compulsory 5 days in the middle where everyone will be around.

During the team trip, weâ€™ll be unavailable for client work. We schedule client sprints accordingly, to give us the time and space to make each team trip a success with little to no distractions.
