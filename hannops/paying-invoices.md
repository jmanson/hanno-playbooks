# Paying invoices with Transferwise

_Some simple instructions for clients who choose to pay our invoices with Transferwise._

We have local EUR, GBP and USD accounts and issue invoices in all 3 currencies.

For clients who don't operate in any of the 3 currencies, we highly recommend [Transferwise](https://transferwise.com/) for making invoice payments.

Transferwise is a currency exchange service built by former engineers at Skype. It's extremely reputable and has received a lot of press coverage. It's our view that Transferwise doesn't carry any real risks and we use it to make the vast majority of our own outbound transfers too--we've transferred hundreds of thousands of pounds with the service and have had no issues.

The fee structure at Transferwise often leads to significant savings when compared to most (but not all) traditional banks. By allowing you to transfer money at the real rate, you don't lose out on commission, especially when making big invoice payments.

## Create your account
As long as your [currency is supported](https://transferwise.com/help/article/1569835/basic-information/supported-currencies) (most are, including USD, EUR and most other European and major international currencies), you can send money via Transferwise.

Account setup takes a day or two and like any financial service will require you to have proof of identity like your passport and utility bills.

## Transfer funds
Once your account is up and running, visit the 'create transfer' page.

If your Hanno invoices is in GBP, select your own currency at the top, and GBP at the bottom.

Then __click into the input field for GBP__ and enter the GBP value of the invoice you're going to pay. By doing this, Transferwise will lock the payment total so that the exact GBP total is transferred.

Then, specify that you're wanting to make a payment to a new recipient and that this person is a Business or charity.

When entering the payment information, adding the Hanno email address will send us a handy little notification too, saving you some time.

Once you've added all our bank account details, Transferwise will ask you to transfer the corresponding amount in your own currency, into their local bank account.

So if you're in Australia, they'll give you an Australian bank account number for you to send your money to. Everything else will be automated and you'll be notified once the payment gets sent. Simple!
