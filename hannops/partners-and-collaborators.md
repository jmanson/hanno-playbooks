# Parnters and Collaborators

Working with third parties on client projects.

Where we feel it would help us to do a better job on a project, we may bring in collaborators to help us. These contractors will be booked on the same, weekly basis, and will become full-time members of the project during the booking.

Confidentiality of project and client information is important, so each of these contractors will sign a standard _Independent Contractor Agreement_. This will be sent out from HelloSign, and sets out our standard confidentiality terms, along with other conditions for working on the project.

We’ll also send a single booking document, which will set out the dates we’re booking to work together.

Collaborators will join the project's Slack channel and be added to the project management tools (such as Asana) that they need in order to carry out their roles.
