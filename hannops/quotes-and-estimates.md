# Quotes & Estimates

An introduction to invoicing and estimates on projects

## Pricing & Engagement Summaries

If we’ve been able to gain consensus for the project and assemble a team, and we've chosen to run a sprint, we’ll send over an _Engagement Summary_, which sets out:

- The number of team members
- The project duration
- The project goal
- The price of the project (and where appropriate, the weekly rate)
- The currency for the project - this will be in GBP, USD or EUR, depending on the client's location.

## Invoices

We are a UK incorporated company, and so all invoices and rates are subject to VAT. The currency used will be the one agreed in the Engagement Summary.

Payment is taken via bank transfer. We recommend that clients check their bank fees: if you're making large payments in foreign currencies, it may be cheaper to use [TransferWise](https://transferwise.com/).

## Scheduling Sprints

Before booking a project sprint into our team schedule, we will send an upfront invoice for the first week/milestone of the sprint. This is the only invoice we send which is not on net-14 payment terms--rather, it is due ASAP.

During discussions with the client up to this point, we’ll give them approximate estimates for when the project might be able to be scheduled. However, no dates are fixed until we have a signed contract, confirmed _Engagement Summary_ and the first invoice has been paid.
