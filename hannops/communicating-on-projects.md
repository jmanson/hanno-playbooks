# Communicating on projects

_Which tools do we use on client projects?_


When working on a project, the tools vary, based on what we feel will be the best fit for the client and the project in question. We’ll often use Asana to run projects, but if the client has a defined workflow and we need to integrate into it, we’ll switch from anything from GitHub issues, to apps such as JIRA.

While we use Asana for nearly all our internal tasks at Hanno, it's common for us to use Trello as a task management tool on projects as it's a little more visual and versatile and can be easier for clients to grasp.

We are huge fans of Google Docs. If written communication is not in Asana, it will be in a Google Doc. If we find ourselves writing a long message in Basecamp, we stop, turn it into a Google Doc, and send that link via a Basecamp message or an Asana task.
