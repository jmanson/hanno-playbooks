# Invoicing Clients

_How to issue invoices to clients_

The shipmates on a sprint are responsible for making sure that invoices get sent out. That's pretty simple in Xero, once you get the hang of it, but the first time you do it, you'll need to take things slowly and learn how to get it right.

## When to send an invoice

* With a new client or a new sprint series, an upfront invoice has to be sent before a sprint. This would be due for the first sprint week. These invoices are __due immediately__.
* For an ongoing sprint, invoices are sent out every Wednesday. These invoices are due __within 14 days__.

## ðŸ‘® Stop! Has this client been invoiced before?

Before you can send any invoices, you'll need to make sure the client has been correctly set up inside Xero. Head to [Verifying Clients](hannops/verifying-clients.md).

Once they've been verified, you're ready to send an invoice!

## Go to Xero and check the existing invoices

We don't want to send an invoice to a client twice, and it's important that your sprint crew knows what's going on. So, please keep them updated in Asana or elsewhere, so that this process runs smoothly.

Visit the [Xero Dashboard](https://go.xero.com/Dashboard/Default.aspx). You'll be able to see our upcoming invoices.

## Then, generate a new invoice draft

Assuming the sprint hasn't been invoiced yet, then From the dashboard or Invoices page, click to __create a new sales invoice__.

![invoices2](https://www.datocms-assets.com/1058/1495465434-invoices2.png?w=1000&fit=max)

You'll land on the blank invoice screen:

![invoices3](https://www.datocms-assets.com/1058/1495465450-invoices3.png?w=1000&fit=max)

The __To__ field on the new draft invoice allows you to select a customer to invoice. Since you've already handled the process of Verifying Clients, they should already be in the system, and they'll appear when you search for them:

## Fill in the basic invoice details

#### Choose the recipient

You should have added and fixed up the client in Verifying Clients, and now, you'll be able to address the invoice to them. Begin typing their name into the To field, and they will pop up in the menu which appears, for you to select:

### Set the invoice date and due date

You'll typically select today's date in the __Date__ drop-down. When you select it, it will automatically set the due date of the invoice, too.

Nearly all of our invoices are sent out at net-14 (due 2 weeks from the date of the invoice)--this is the timeline we chose when we set the __Sales Invoices Default Due Date__ to be due __14 day(s) after the invoice date__ in Verifying Clients.

You can manually override this on a single invoice basis if you need to, but that shouldn't be necessary.

#### Unless you need to add a PO number, leave the reference number alone

The Invoice # will be incremented automatically. Please don't change this.

#### Set the Branding (the invoice template)

Ensure the invoice template is set to __Bank transfer only__.

## Add the invoice items

#### Tax calculations

The dropdown should show that amounts are Tax Exclusive. Again, this is a default we set up in Verifying Clients, so head there if it's not showing up correctly.

#### Invoice rows

Try to keep the invoices as clear as possible, and using a consistent format.

- Item can be left blank
- Description should follow a consistent format. For simplicity, please mention the week being invoiced, so it's obvious to anyone looking back. i.e. don't just say "Sprint 1"
  - [Product Crew] week ending [6th May]
  - Advance payment for [Product Crew] week ending [6th May]
  - etc
- Qty should match the number of shipmates on the sprint
  - If there were 3 that week, mark it as 3 shipmates.
  - If we're doing a fixed-price product, like a 5-day sprint, then it's probably easiest to invoice it as qty: 1.
- Unit Price should be either:
  - The price per shipmate, per week (typically Â£3k)
  - The fixed price for the product (e.g. Â£12k for the 5-Day Sprint)
- Account should automatically fill itself in when you click into the field. That default will be 200 - Sales and there shouldn't be any reason to change this.
- Tax will also automatically fill itself in as you click into the Account field. It shouldn't need changing, in most cases. To summarise (but please check this with a shipmate if you are at all unsure):
  - UK clients = 20% (VAT on Income)
  - EU clients without a VAT number = 20% (VAT on Income)
  - EU clients with a VAT number = Zero Rated EC Services
  - Outside the EU = No VAT

Here's an example of how this would look for a few common sprints we might book/run with a UK client:

## Check and clean up the invoice

When you're done, you'll need to make sure everything looks okay. Please do this before saving the invoice.

You can click the small 'x' marks to the right of empty rows in the invoice, to clear them:

![invoices9](https://www.datocms-assets.com/1058/1495465682-invoices9.png?w=1000&fit=max)


## Click to approve the invoice
ðŸ‘® __Please be careful here__. If you're not ready to finalise the invoice, it's a better option to just save a draft of it for now while you get a second opinion.

Once you're done, click the big green Approve button at the bottom.

![invoices10](https://www.datocms-assets.com/1058/1495465737-invoices10.png?w=1000&fit=max)

![invoices11](https://www.datocms-assets.com/1058/1495465750-invoices11.png?w=1000&fit=max)

You'll receive a confirmation that this has completed.

## Send the invoice to the client
You should this via email. Click to Print PDF and then send it to the client, BCCing accounting@hanno.co.

Don't forget to chase up the client and make sure the invoice gets paid!
