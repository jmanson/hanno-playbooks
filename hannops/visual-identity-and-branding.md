# Visual identity & branding

_Turning your brand's vision into a worthy visual identity_

Brand loyalty is driven by how a brand looks, feels and tells its story.

We familiarise ourselves with your narrative and your future vision before translating thse into a visual identity that will engage and delight your audience.

Since 'branding' is about much more than simply visual identity, we also follow a [lean branding approach](https://logbook.hanno.co/beware-brand-designers/) that places a lot of importance on how your brand chooses to communicate and interact with users. We'll help to guide you towards a compelling brand strategy that matches your [organisational purpose](hannops/organisational-purpose)!

_We'll update this page soon with a closer look at how we tackle this_.
