_This content here is designed to help shipmates to communicate what Hanno is about, and for others to understand us better. For details on our pitching and lead validation process, it's well worth reading the [Lead Qualification](hannops/lead-qualification.md) page of this Playbook._

## Value proposition for startups

Hanno is a highly skilled, distributed design team that can work with you no matter where you're based in the world.

We have deep experience working with startups and we've also built up a highly effective design process. If you're building or launching a digital product, we can show you the best way to do it.

Your goal is to build the right product and to do that efficiently. We can slot into your team and help you do that: with both hands-on work and also by coaching and upskilling your team so that they can continue to do this work even if we're no longer around.

Selected startups we’ve worked with include [Uber](https://hanno.co/work/uber), [Prepd](https://hanno.co/work/prepd/), [Mirror](https://hanno.co/work/mirror), [Zirx](https://hanno.co/work/zirx) and [Ava](https://hanno.co/work/ava/).

In short:

* As a proven and experienced design team, we will help your startup to make better decisions, better products, and solve problems faster.
* As a team that is available on-demand, we will step in in the short term to boost the capacity of your team if you're not able or ready to make permanent hires.
* We will help you introduce a design culture and methodology within your team, levelling up your skills and culture.
* As experienced builders of design teams, we will help you to transition to hiring your own design team to replace us if that's what you need.


## Value proposition for Corporates

Hanno is an experienced design team with a track record of helping both high-growth startups and also corporates to __build and launch digital products__.

We're not an ad or marketing agency - we're a team of designers, strategists and engineers who understand every aspect of building great digital products. Our experience in the startup world means we don't operate like a typical agency, but we have the corporate experience and established design process to deliver great, reliable results.

Our goal is to help you build the __right product__ by following a structured, user-research driven process. This scientific approach allows us to convince internal stakeholders of the correct way to build and launch your product and to avoid internal politics and compromised end results.

Selected corporates we’ve worked with include [Lenovo](https://www.lenovoappexplorer.com/en_us/), [Betfair](https://www.betfair.com/), Sony and [IAG/Avios](https://www.avios.com/gb/en_gb/). We've also worked with several others under NDA.
