# Holidays

Our philosophy on holiday pay and paid leave

## Annual leave

We work Monday-Friday. Full-time shipmates make their own decisions about how much holiday theyâ€™d like to take each year and are responsible for scheduling this. We try to make sure that everyone takes at least 35 days of holiday per year.

## Public holidays

Since the team is entirely remote, conventional public/bank holidays in the UK or elsewhere are not automatically considered to be days off. If you want to take the day off though, you just have to book it.

## Booking holidays

Shipmates announce their holiday plans on Slack in our __#timeoff__ channel to check for scheduling issues. If there are no major problems, they then add their holiday dates into [Forecast](https://forecastapp.com/).

The main requirement is that you plan holidays to minimise disruption on projects and help your project team to find a replacement if you're going to be unavailable.

If booking a holiday more than 2 months in advance, there are unlikely to be scheduling issues. For shorter requests, it will depend upon sprint scheduling and whether we can find other shipmates or collaborators to help to make up for the absent shipmates.

## Taking additional holiday

Shipmates choose their own salary and the general expectation is that if they want to take a lot more than 35 days of holiday each year, they will factor this into their salary proposals.

## Sick leave

You should make sure you have proper medical cover and insurance in whichever country you're based in. Never travel without having full travel insurance. Please don't make your shipmates carry the burden if you need medical care.

With that said, if you're ill: look after yourself, and don't work! Resting up is the best option. If you feel like you need the day off, decide what's reasonable, and notify the team. Don't feel obligated to drag yourself to work if you're feeling terrible.

If you want to make up for some of that time later on, feel free, but please don't feel like you have to make up for every sick day you take. Everybody gets ill, sometimes.
