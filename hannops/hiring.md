How we recruit for new shipmates

__We're always on the lookout for designers and makers to grow our team. These include full-time and regular collaborators__.

## Who we're looking for

* For current positions, check out our [jobs page](https://hanno.co/jobs). To receive email updates about new shipmate openings, follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wearehanno) or [sign up to our newsletter](https://hanno.co/newsletter).
* __Awesome freelance collaborators__. We can't make any promises, but occasionally we have opportunities for non-core shipmates to join us on sprints. If you can work within our system of weekly, full-time sprints for 2+ weeks at a time, and think you'd bring a serious skill to the team, feel free to get in touch.
* __Smaller teams__. If you're a smaller, more specialist team who works in a similar way and think there's a chance we can team up on a project of yours, please let us know! We have a good network of collaborators already, but if you can bring exciting new projects to us, we'll always be ready to listen.

If you think we’re missing a huge opportunity to do something and think you can fill that gap, then please go ahead and fill in our [Open Applications](https://hanno.co/jobs/open/)! We’re always willing to listen to great ideas, and perhaps you’ll be able to convince us that we need you on board.

## Our current deal-breakers

There are a couple of things which make it very unlikely that we’ll consider you as a new hire, for now:

* __If you’re not a fully-fluent English speaker__: we blog and write a lot, as a team, and we have quite a few non-native speakers on the team. We know that you don’t have to be a native English speaker in order to be a great designer, but we have come to a team decision that for our next few shipmates, we really do need them to have fluent written and spoken English, so we can rebalance the team.
* __Junior hires, interns and apprentices__: sadly, we’ve not set up to take on board junior shipmates right now, because we don’t have the time to fully train and build people up. To help us step up the quality of our work, we need more experienced shipmates to join us.

## Hiring tips

Here are things we like to see from people who message us:

* [Try and write some stuff](https://logbook.hanno.co/hey-designer-get-hired/)
* [Please don't send a dull CV: build yourself a website!](https://logbook.hanno.co/designer-get-hired-again/)

If we’ve not worked together before, then the first project we will work on will be a (fully paid!) sprint together, so that everyone can see how it feels to work together.

If the sprint goes well, we’ll talk about what we’d both need to do to make things happen again on a more regular basis, whether that's as a full-time core team member, or as a recurring collaborator.
