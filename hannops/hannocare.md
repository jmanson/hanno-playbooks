# HannoCare - Therapy

Sometimes remote shipmates may need a little extra professional support.

Sometimes, working remotely can be extremely isolating. We do a lot to try and build a fun and social atmosphere at Hanno but from time to time, some people can benefit from extra support. Especially if they're the kind of people who thrive on physical interactions.

If people have their own personal mental challenges outside of work, the combination of those issues, plus work challenges and the remote work environment can be a really tough one, and it can have a huge effect on happiness and satisfaction at work.

We don’t feel that mental unhappiness and ill-health should carry any stigma. Just like the rest of your body, you might need support or advice to keep your mind healthy and positive.

It’s not in Hanno’s interests if dedicated shipmates start feeling isolated, depressed or overwhelmed. We want all of our team to feel like they can stay as part of Hanno for the long-term. Happy shipmates are productive, energised and maximise our chances of succeeding. That’s why HannoCare exists, to make sure everyone on the team has access to professional therapy support if they feel they need it.

## How much can I claim for therapy?

HannoCare is available to all legal employees in the UK as a standard benefit up to a maximum of __£300/month__. You’ll need to notify us if you want to claim this benefit, but as long as it meets the rules below, it will be automatically accepted.

## What can I use HannoCare for?

HannoCare is based on the [HMRC tax exemption for welfare counselling](https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/employment-income-manual/eim21845) and so counselling on any of the following topics is allowed:

- Stress
- Problems at work
- Debt problems
- Alcohol and other drug dependencies
- Career concerns
- Bereavement
- Equal Opportunities
- Ill-health
- Sexual Abuse
- Harassment and Bullying
- Conduct & Discipline
- Personal Relationship Difficulties.

## What can't I use HannoCare for?

However, the following types of counselling are not claimable, since HMRC does not permit these:

- Medical treatment of any kind
- Advice on finance, other than advice on debt problems
- Advice on tax
- Advice on leisure or recreation
- Legal advice


## How do I claim it?

To claim HannoCare, here’s what you need to do:

- You do not need to submit a detailed AP request to claim HannoCare. While we totally support shipmates who are comfortable with talking about their mental health challenges (because we feel there is no stigma attached to these topics), we understand that some people won’t be comfortable doing this, and we’ll respect their wishes. HannoCare can be signed off confidentially by any Director of Hanno (legally, a director has to sign this kind of contract).
- The invoice for the welfare counselling or therapy needs to be made out to Hanno directly, and we have to pay it ourselves. It’s not possible to submit welfare counselling invoices as expense claims.
- Hanno must directly communicate with the welfare counselling service you’ve chosen, to explain that we can only pay for support on the allowable topics above. If your counselling service gives you support on other topics, we’ll ask that they move these into a separate invoice, made out to you personally.

If the employee requires more than the £300/month benefit that’s available, this can be separately agreed if necessary and may be subject to an AP request, depending on the circumstances.
