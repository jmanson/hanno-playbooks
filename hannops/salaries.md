# Salaries

As part of being self-managed, our team also chooses their own salary

As part of being a self-managing team, each shipmate is also able to __choose their own salary__.

We’ve done the research, analysed lots of examples about how self-managed salaries have been done successfully in the past, and we think we’ve come up with a fairly robust way of doing them.

## The salary change process
It might seem a little bit complex at first, but in reality it’s far simpler than either a perfect formula which encompasses all possible variables, or an opaque, politicised negotiation and secret list of team salaries:

1. Along with Jon's regular _state-of-play_ update to the team, we also include a financial advisory on the current company financial status, with a __general opinion and recommendation for the salary direction__ that the team should be thinking about for this upcoming review, based on our financial status. That’s not an instruction, but rather, an informed opinion–under the principles of self-management that we’re moving towards, people are free to make their own decision, taking my opinion into account (and disregarding it if they choose)
2. __The team react to this guidance with a round of feedback and opinions__. Some might even disagree with the assessment and call Jon out on that. Some might request more information or clarifications. Jon will do his best to provide that.
3. __Shipmates takes time to think about the finances and their own salary needs__. They can ask for advice or opinions from others while they’re putting together this proposal, and we’re suggested taking into account a few factors when working out a figure - those are listed below.
4. __The shipmate puts together a proposal__, in whatever format they choose, for how much they want to receive in the next few months. It’s recommended that they explain their thought process in sufficient detail, especially if it’s an increase since the last salary review, because this will make it easier for their shipmates to understand their thinking and motivations. They post this on Loomio.
5. Just as the team reacted to my proposal, now we have a __reaction round from the team, to this individual shipmate’s salary proposal__. This isn’t a battle: it’s a conversation, and the shipmate is obliged to _listen_ to the feedback from the team.
Shipmates are free to modify their salary proposal based on that feedback, but they don’t have to do so, if they disagree with the advice. That’s the power which comes along with self-management! This idea of listening to opinions, but not being obliged to follow them if you strongly believe otherwise, is part of what we call our [_Advisory Process_](hannops/advisory-process.md), which we’re documenting at the moment and trialling as we shift to become a teal thinking organisation. I’ll be writing about how we’ve come up with this system in another blogpost in the next couple of weeks.
7. Under the Advisory Process, there is just _1 ground for a salary proposal being declined_: if there is a genuine risk that the salary being proposed would cause irreparable harm, or move Hanno backwards.
8. Pay for every member of the team is __documented in a spreadsheet for everyone to see and refer to__, along with the forecasted upcoming payments to the whole team, so that we can accurately plan our outgoing costs for the next 3 months.

## Questions to ask when deciding on a salary figure
We recommend thinking about these questions before deciding on a salary figure:

1. __How much do I need to earn, in order to live and to be satisfied with my pay__?
2. __How do the next 3-6 months look for me__? Thinking about longer periods should help to discourage big swings in compensation, which will make it hard to budget.
3. __How much can Hanno afford to pay__? The whole team has access to our financial dashboard and budgeting dashboard hosted by Float, which uses the live financial data from our Xero account. So there’s total transparency to how much money the company is making and spending, which is critical for this whole process to work.
4. __How much do my fellow shipmates earn__? We have a spreadsheet which lists how much everyone in the team has been paid each month, this year.
5. __How much do other people in my city/country earn__?
6. __How much do people with my skills and responsibilities earn elsewhere__.

## A note on retrospective salary increases

This is very much related to our [AP rules](hannops/advisory-process.md) banning retroactive proposals.

If we know we upcoming outgoings of £200k in the next 3 months, we'll plan our finances and outgoing around this to ensure we have financial stability.

When someone proposes a salary increase, it's considered by the team based on the financial status of Hanno. If it involves an increase of $1000/month, we'll bake that into our financial roadmap if the AP is approved.

Being able to plan effectively depends on having a clear view of those obligations.

If someone is to present a proposal to say "I think I deserve more money for my work in the past year and I now want to claim 12 months of backdated pay, totalling $12,000, this creates an immediate, unplanned financial hit to the team.

So the presumption with salary proposals is that while you're welcome to request a __salary increase__ for the future, __you can't retroactively increase your salary for work done in the past__.
