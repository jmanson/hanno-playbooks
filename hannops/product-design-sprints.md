# Product design sprints & rapid prototyping

Taking you from post-it note to validated prototype, in just a couple of days.

We're a team of designers whose focus is on digital product design. That means that we're particularly experienced when it comes to developing digital products like apps and websites.

Our product design sprints are based on the [Google Ventures design sprint model](http://www.gv.com/sprint/) and the [design thinking process](https://www.ideou.com/pages/design-thinking) for creative problem-solving.

They're a great way to rapidly build and validate a prototype from scratch or to improve an existing product. In just a few intense days, we can work with you and your team to develop new ideas, overcome challenges and validate solutions quickly and with minimal resources.

We explore multiple possibilities and get stakeholders involved to co-create solutions. Together, weâ€™ll unleash our creativity and generate new ideas that will improve the user experience of your product in various scenarios.

Our constant iterative process is a cost-effective way to design solutions quickly until we achieve leading-edge experiences for a better user adoption.

Our design abilities and the framework we use can apply equally to __service design__ and broader challenges, too.

To give a better idea of what can be achieved on a sprint, here's a short video from Pieter and Thibault of [Ava](https://hanno.co/work/ava/) (formerly Transcense) talking about how we helped them run a prototyping and validation sprint with their team:

We'll be updating this page soon with more details on how we run our product design sprints. In the meantime, [take a look at our internal wiki](https://github.com/wearehanno/designthinking/wiki) which gives some insight into how we run our sprints.
