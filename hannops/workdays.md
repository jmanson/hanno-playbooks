The working day at Hanno

The workday for a shipmate at Hanno is __8 working hours__ - while in rare situations it may be a little longer, this is the goal we hold ourselves to.

If any shipmate is consistently working longer than this, that indicates that there’s a problem to be resolved in either their personal approach or our internal processes.

As a team, we are highly productive and [invest heavily in tools](http://hanno.co/logbook/investing-in-tools-no-brainer) to allow us to be this way. Our philosophy is always that the number of hours worked has no correlation with the quality of work produced.

When working on a project sprint, the amount of time that will be spent on client work will be up to 7 hours in a day. The remaining hour of the day goes towards off-sprint work such as internal reviews, research, planning and internal work, all of which allows us to deliver better results when we’re on a sprint.
