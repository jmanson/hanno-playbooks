# Workshops

We run many different workshops to help clients with their design and organisational challenges.

We’ve run workshops within Hanno for a long time and gradually extended these to teach our clients many of our techniques and methodologies. You can view a few of our workshops on [the Hanno website](https://hanno.co/workshops/).

## When do we run workshops?

* Workshops can be __standalone services__, where we’re hired to consult and coach on a specific challenge, especially when it relates to organisational change.
* But they can also be delivered __as part of a typical product design project__. For example, we might run a [user testing workshop](https://hanno.co/workshops/user-testing/) as part of a design sprint to make sure that our client understands how to validate ideas for future sprints and is comfortable gathering user feedback on concepts: a crucial part of any UX design process.
* On certain projects, such as those involving brand identity and strategy, workshops are __an essential part of our process__ - we’d rarely run a project like this without some sort of workshopping component with our client’s team.

It’s common for us to discuss workshops as part of the solution on
