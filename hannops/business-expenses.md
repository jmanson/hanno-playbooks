# Business Travel Expenses

Travelling for work can be expensive. Here are our guidelines for claiming reimbursement.

When a shipmate is travelling on an international business trip for Hanno, we’ll cover your reasonable expenses to offset the extra cost of living that comes with travelling.

The process depends on your employment status:

* __Legal employees__: you can follow the rules below for submitting expenses. You must file receipts in order to get the expenses.
* __Independent contractors__: we expect you to invoice us a larger amount if you're travelling to work with us. But you can’t file expenses and receipts directly as these need to go through your own business. __You’ll need to negotiate any travelling fees and add this total to your next invoice__.

As a general rule, __keep it lean, do your research, and use your judgement__: if you wouldn’t pay for something when you were at home because it’s excessively expensive (a taxi ride around the corner instead of taking the tube) then please don’t do it just because you’re not picking up the bill. Higher Hanno profits allow us to pay the rest of the team more!

_By the way, please keep in mind that these guidelines do not apply to team retreats._

## Pre-trip: Travel costs

If you're an employee with your own Hanno credit card, that's the best way to pay for these costs. You won't need to pay from your own savings and won't need to submit an expense claim later on:

* __Return flights__. Remember: international flights usually have No VAT. Check the booking terms and if they require you to travel using the credit card, make sure you actually have a physical card.
* __Transfer fees to get to the airport__. Please don't go via luxury limo.
* __Pre-booked accommodation__. We have a company AirBnb account - please use this for AirBnb bookings. Ask Jon for access if you can't find it.

## During the trip: Automatic expense budget

Once your flights, accommodation and airport transfers have been paid for, we also have a simple, automatic allowance for expenses.

You don't need to submit an AP if you're spending within these limits on a work trip:

* __Up to £200/week__ in an expensive travel location (such as San Francisco).
* In a cheaper location, it might be a little less - it’s up to you to decide. Please decide on a provisional allowance before the trip.
* __If you need a larger budget, submit an AP__: for example, _if you need to take several long train rides and taxis in order to visit a lot of VC investors in a single day, this will probably be pricey and would blow through your default budget._

This budget is designed to cover the additional costs of travelling for work once you get to your destination. It can be used for expenses like:

* Travel - taxi/Uber receipts and airport transfers, public transport tickets/receipts
* Food - the extra cost of eating out (at affordable places, not fine dining for the sake of it), or basic groceries to keep you fed and hydrated.
* Phone - the cost of a SIM card

## Employee expense submission guidelines

Please keep in mind:

* If you don't have a receipt and you don't submit it into [ReceiptBank](https://www.receipt-bank.com/receipt-scanning-app/), we can't pay you for the expense. Download the ReceiptBank app to make this easier for yourself.
* You can’t file for a cash top up to take yourself up to the default expense budget. If you only have receipts for £170 of legitimate purchases for a 1-week trip, we can’t just transfer you an extra £30 as an expense payment so that you reach the £200 limit.
* Expense claims are subject to very strict tax regulations. If the expense is something you’d buy while you were at home (a coffee on your way to work; a beer after work) then you can’t expense it.
* All expenses need to be __wholly, exclusively and necessary for business__. HMRC can challenge costs if they think there is a mix of business and personal, and we’ll not be able to repay you for these.
* Your expense report will be publicly visible to anyone on the team who wants to look at it later on. Make sure you’re willing to justify any purchases you make.
* __Please avoid 'client entertaining costs'__ where you can. We can repay you for expenses, but we can’t claim back corporation tax on them. This means they're expensive for us.

## The process:

This is pretty much the same as the usual process. But watch out for taxes!

1. Take photos of every receipt while travelling. Make sure it is clear and detailed, to avoid confusion later.
2. Send the image to ReceiptBank - their mobile app is the best way to do this.
3. When you return from the trip, check all the transactions in ReceiptBank.
4. When checked, file all your expenses in a single Expense Report and publish it.

Please check the VAT on your expenses before you submit the claim:

* Items bought when abroad should be saved in the "Travel (International)" - you should make sure they have no VAT or tax on them. If an item is $100 + $5 sales tax, mark it as $105 with no VAT.
* If you're in the EU, this same rule applies. We can only reclaim VAT on services from the EU when they're delivered to the UK. So make sure EU expenses have 'No VAT' as well.
* Check your invoices - for services like AirBnb, the accommodation itself won't have any tax on it, but the 'service fees' will, and we can claim this. Ask Jon if you're unsure.
* For services in the UK (including transport) - we can probably claim the tax back. File the item in the most likely category and check your receipt to see if any VAT is stated on it.
