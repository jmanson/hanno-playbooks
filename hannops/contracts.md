# Contracts

How our standard contracts and agreements work for booking in projects.

## Business details

We’ll send prospective clients a link to our business details form. This is a form attached to a Google spreadsheet. Once they complete it, it will automatically create profiles for them inside [Xero](https://xero.com/) (our billing platform) and inside our other apps.

## The Consulting Contract

We have a standard _Consulting Contract_, which we send out to the client from our [HelloSign](https://www.hellosign.com/) account for e-signing. Contracts are stored in Google Drive.

The contract sample is publicly visible [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jwNIyJtu2oBfR_yvMoZK4Qt3z6IAZUeTZjdMwOiq5NE/edit?usp=sharing). __Disclaimer: For anyone outside of Hanno looking at this contract and thinking about using it with their own clients, please do not use this contract for your own purposes without getting independent legal advice! We accept no responsibility, either way__.

The contract will be signed by the client, and one of our directors.

This Contract is purposefully broad and covers many different project types. It won’t include any detail about the client’s specific project. It’s also applicable to any _Engagement_ we work on together. This means that once it’s signed, we can schedule sprints without needing to sign new contracts each time.

The contract covers basics such as:

- Confidentiality and non-disclosure
- Legal liabilities
- Billing and payment terms
- Engagement terminations - if this is a sprint-based project, the Engagement can be ended by either us, or the client, giving notice before the end of a sprint week. The Engagement will then end at the end of the week.
- Legal jurisdiction: our contracts are under the laws of England and Wales.
