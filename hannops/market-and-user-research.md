# Market & user research

Understand what your users need and how your product can address that need.

Using empathy to engage with real experiences, we observe and immerse ourselves in peopleâ€™s lives to identify their needs and behaviours. We turn assumptions into verifiable insights.

We conduct in-depth qualitative interviews and probe into upcoming trends to provide an extensive overview that will improve your decision-making for new opportunities.

We're user research experts and have even [built our own product](https://hellopingpong.com/) to make it easier for companies to run better user research.

_We'll update this page soon with a closer look at how we tackle this_.
