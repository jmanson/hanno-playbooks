# Product strategy

Helping you to create a clear strategy to keep your product development on track

We're all for lean, iterative design and experimentation as you build out a new product. Hacking together prototypes on the fly is a huge part of what we do.

But once you get beyond hacking and have a validated prototype that you're about to pour serious investment into, it's no good to just keep coding away and hope for the best. __You need a product strategy__.

Given our experience with the whole cycle of product development, from [user research](hannops/user-research.md) to UX design to [product engineering](hannops/product-engineering.md), we're also brilliantly placed to help teams to identify their product strategy.

And as their product evolves, our __product management__ support can help them stay on track.

## What is a product strategy?

A product strategy isn't a rigid plan or roadmap for what to do and build for the next X months. All that delivers is a dangerous illusion of certainty and confidence.

To get to a product strategy, we need to understand:

* Your __user goals__ and __objectives__
* Your __business objectives__ and context (including your cash runway and other factors)

And ultimately we need to end up with a _product strategy_ which sets out:

* A clear __vision__ for where your company needs to get to
* The next big __challenge__ in the customer journey (ideally in a quantitative way) which we can use to focus all of our upcoming product development around.

## What can we help with?

We can help you figure out the answers to tricky questions like:

* What do our users need: how can start talking to them and how can we learn which features will deliver most value?
* How should we balance our budget and long-term roadmap to decide which features to include in our _minimum viable_ product (MVP)?
* How should we prioritise our long-term feature backlog?
* What's the best approach to take our product to market?
* Would it make sense to switch component X in our 'stack' to a new framework?
* How can we change our team's way of working to improve our product

## Product strategy as standard
Product strategy is an almost essential part of most of our product design and engineering projects. If we're being brought in to build a new feature or to design a whole product from scratch, it's impossible for us to approach that task without considering the wider implications of your product roadmap and the product as a whole.

Likewise if we're building out your product over the course of several weeks or months: it's inevitable that over the course of working together, we team up to discuss your product priorities and come up with a clear product strategy target to make sure we're moving in the right direction together!
