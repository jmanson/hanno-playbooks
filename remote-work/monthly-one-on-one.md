# Monthly 1:1 Calls

_Our monthly 1:1s allow us to talk deeply about the challenges we're facing at work._

One of our most important cultural values is that we will [never settle](hannops/mission#values). This means we work really hard to help our shipmates grow.

These calls were originally carried out by [Jon](https://hanno.co/team/jon/). We're gradually going to transition them to a team responsibility, as far as possible.

## Structure

We'll need:
* A coach
* A subject

You'll have 2x calls per month. One as the coach, and another as the subject. The goal is to speak for 1hr on each call, so that you get a proper change to talk about what you're struggling with.


## Ahead of the call

The coach will send over a brief 'conversation starter' to the shipmate a day or two ahead of the call, using the 7Geese 1:1 function, and the template Coach > Shipmate: Monthly 1:1 Prep. There are 2 pieces of feedback in this:

1. __Here's something I thought you did really well last month...__ _I'd like to recognise your hard work on this._
2. __Here's something that you seemed to be struggling with...__ _I'd like to hear your side of the story on this, so I can understand your problem better._

And for prep work:

* The shipmate should ensure their OKRs are up-to-date
* Both the shipmate and the coach should review the shipmate's OKRs
* A timeslot should be booked into their calendars


## The call

### What's on your mind?

The format of the call is up to the participants. But we usually:

* Kick off with this question: _"What's on your mind?"_
* Dedicate some time to talking about what was good
* Dedicate some more time to talking about tough problems and challenges, both last month, and also coming up soon
* Discuss progress on their OKRs

### Ground Rules

* The shipmate leads the call, and talks about things they want to discuss.
* __The coach is not a manager.__ The coach should not give commands or prescriptions--they're only able to ask questions and offer advice if that's requested. But they should actively avoid trying to impose their views onto the situation. They're there as a sounding board, not a problem-fixer.
