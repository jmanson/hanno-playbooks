# CHICO

_Adopting a habit of checking in and out can be the glue which keeps a remote team together._

We built a friendly Slackbot called [Oskar](http://oskar.hanno.co/). Somewhat confusingly for new arrivals, inside the Hanno Slack, Oskar is known as Jazz!

Jazz will ping us twice a day to ask how we're feeling, and the results will be shared in our Chico channel in Asana.

We ecourage the team to be open with Jazz as it's our primary way to keep in touch with the team and see how our workmates are feeling. If we know a shipmate is struggling, we'll do our best to rally round them and give them a boost.
