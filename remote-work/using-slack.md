# Using Slack

__Frequently used, easily abused. Here's how to get the most out of Slack.__

As with most other remote teams, we use Slack for internal chatter, direct messaging and general chat between shipmates which is 'live' and doesn't need to be tracked forever.

## Think before you ping!

There's a downside, though: it's easy to ping someone on Slack and request something, but that can be super disruptive and make it hard to get anything done.

That's why we have an internal rule for all tasks which aren't world-endingly _urgent_: __default to Asana__.

Tasks in Asana are easy to spot and easy for the other person to tackle on their own schedule. That's the fair way to communicate with your team!

_We'll be updating this page soon with more Slacktiquette!_
