# Video Calls

_A fundamental part of remote work, but oh-so-easy to get wrong. Let's try to fix that..._
---

As a totally remote team, we can be a little obsessive about making sure that our video calls are easy to follow and participate in. And participation on video calls is even more important for us as one person at Hanno is deaf.

These guidelines are designed to make our calls as smooth as possible and break down some of the barriers of remote collaboration and communication.

If you‚Äôre a client working with Hanno, every one of our shipmates will thank you if you‚Äôre able to adopt some of these guidelines üòÑ

## Using Zoom

We strongly favour Zoom for video calls. After a lot of testing, we‚Äôve found that it is the best video platform for handling calls with lots of participants, especially when some of them are on less reliable connections.

## Remote group call etiquette

A few tips we‚Äôd recommend on all group calls can improve the conversation a lot:

* Mute your microphone if you‚Äôre not speaking: this is essential on a large call so that background noise from one person doesn‚Äôt degrade the call for everyone else.
* Raise your hand if you‚Äôd like to speak when someone else is talking. This is a simple visual cue that everyone else can follow.
* Show a thumbs up or thumbs down sign to agree/disagree on a group call.
* Make fewer ‚Äòlistening sounds‚Äô on group calls. If you‚Äôre saying ‚Äúuh huh‚Äù, ‚Äúyup‚Äù, ‚Äúdefinitely‚Äù while someone is talking, this can interrupt and distract them and make it harder for others to follow.

## Improving your audio and video

Let's take a look at an example of a bad call at Hanno: you'll see that many people have bad camera quality, poor lighting and awkward off-center camera angles. Some don't even have microphones!



Take that as an example of what not to do! Here are some practical tips that can make calls a much more enjoyable experience:

* First, the most obvious one: __find the quietest environment possible__ before joining the call. Don‚Äôt make calls from noisy shared spaces.
* __Speak up immediately__ if you can‚Äôt hear on a call - even if it‚Äôs not fixable on the current call, making people aware of potential issues allows them to fix it next time. Most of the time, they‚Äôre probably not aware that it‚Äôs an issue.
* If you happen to be in the same place as another participant, __don‚Äôt sit in the same room__! If you do have to be in the same room, make sure that you never have both microphones switched on at the same time.
* Be aware of __environment quality__: hard surfaces + no sound insulation in your room + bad microphone = echoing and bad audio for other participants.
* Get the fastest internet speed possible. Pay careful attention to __upload speed__, not just download, because this is usually the bottleneck on most video calls. If you‚Äôre a full-time remote worker, invest in high-speed internet.
* If you're on a __bad connection__, you should compensate for this with the best microphone input you can get hold of. You can also look to improve your webcam, but improved video resolution won't help quite as much because of connection. But a better lens with better focus and light handling can still be beneficial.
* __If you have an accent, be aware that you‚Äôll need to take extra steps to compensate for that__. Someone with a perfectly clear accent might get away with a poorer quality microphone, but you‚Äôll want to overcompensate so that your accent doesn‚Äôt make the call harder for others.
* If you have a lot of __facial hair__ you need to make sure you have good lighting, video and microphone to compensate for that. It‚Äôs harder for other people to see your facial expressions or read your lips.
* If you're in a gloomy room, move somewhere with more light. Then sit so that __light is in front of you__ (optimum), illuminating your face and definitely never behind you.
* If you're travelling occasionally, make sure you have a portable solution for calls (especially the microphone) that can last you for short trips. Even if you‚Äôre travelling, don‚Äôt force others to try and hear you through your laptop‚Äôs built-in microphone.
* If you're travelling heavily, accept that you'll need to carry peripherals in your luggage (an external mic and cam) even if that feels like redundant weight. Otherwise you're compromising your ability to do your job - both on internal calls and also on client and group calls.
