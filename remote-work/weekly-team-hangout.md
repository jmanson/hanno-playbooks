# The Weekly Team Hangout

_Once a week, we all jump on a call together to hang out and socialise._

We also have a recurring calendar event for a weekly team call, once a week on __Wednesdays__ on Zoom. This is usually fixed around 11:00 GMT, but the timing occasionally changes if a lot of the team is on an awkward timezone (for example, in the USA).

We track the discussion topics and progresss from previous calls [on a Trello board](https://trello.com/b/5dvspldw/weekly-team-hangout) (visble to Hanno shipmates):

The weekly Hangout is not compulsory if you have a big schedule clash or important commitment, but since it's the 1 time each week where we're all together, it's __strongly recommended__ that everyone jumps in to say hello and participate, even just for part of the call.
