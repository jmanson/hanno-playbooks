# Chatbots

_Some of the most effective apps don't even have a custom interface._

With a growing number of teams using [Slack](https://slack.com/) to communicate, and the power of AI growing ever stronger, it doesn't always make sense to build a web app that requires a keyboard and mouse to navigate.

We got started building bots when we built our own [Slackbot](http://oskar.hanno.co/) to improve our internal culture at Hanno and save time across the team.

Our UX team has also worked with several clients to devise conversational, AI-driven interfaces for [app onboarding](https://hanno.co/work/ava/) and event creation.

We're also able to create bots for the [Facebook Messenger Platform](https://messenger.fb.com/) and other services, to help with customer acquisition, support and engagement.
