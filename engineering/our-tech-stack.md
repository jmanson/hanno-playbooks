# Our tech stack

_Some info on what technology we use_

## JavaScript

Our current stack is based on the latest version of JavaScript, EcmaScript 2015 (or ES6). When not working with node.js (which already supports a lot of ES6 features), we transpile ES6 code using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

## Build tools
As a build tool, we mainly use [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), but also have experience using [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/). With the release of Webpack 2, which has a strong community, extensive plugin system and huge flexibility, we advocate for using it on most our projects.

## Front-end libraries and frameworks
Depending on the project needs, we typically use either [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) or [Angular](https://angular.io/). Both are great options, and our choice usually comes down to the needs of the project.

Even though React is just a view layer for your app, it has a great ecosystem many add-ons for the the model/controller layer to build more complex apps, such as [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) or [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx).

By contrast, Angular comes with a lot of pre-defined structure and tells you how to lay out your app and components. It also enables developers to write more HTML-like code with React, and is a great choice when prototyping app ideas quickly.
