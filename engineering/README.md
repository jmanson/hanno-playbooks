# Engineering

A Playbook for great engineering at Hanno

## We're a small but focused engineering team with plenty of experience building web and mobile apps!

This Playbook, which is currently in active development, is a starting place to allow us to document the tools and processes we use to build apps. We'll be continually adding new articles and information to help others understand the way we work.

## What type of projects do we take on?

Our core-strength is on the front-end side of things, rather than in heavy backend and DevOps work.

We support Hanno's UX and design teams to implement amazing product experiences, but we also function as a standalone engineering team for hire and collaborate with startups and companies who have their own designers.

We focus mainly on:

* Web and mobile apps with JavaScript frameworks such as React or Angular
* Native apps with React Native
* Static websites with HTML/CSS/JS

While we also do back-end development (we’re familiar with node.js, PHP and a little Ruby) and often build out small products and helper applications, we typically avoid building out entire production-ready APIs and backends.

That’s simply because we can’t guarantee the best possible quality here in terms of security, scalability and our own resources. There are other teams that are more experienced and efficient with backend API work and we’ll happily recommend and partner up with these where necessary.

## What have we delivered so far ?

The best way to see our previous work is to check out [Hanno's case studies](https://hanno.co/work/). Some highlights include:

* Building a React Native app for Android and iOS for [Prepd](https://hanno.co/work/prepd/) (we took care of all code on the project).
* Implementing a great frontend marketing web experience (with plenty of progressive animation work) with [Stratim](https://hanno.co/work/stratim/) (Hanno was in charge of all design and code on the project). We also built out a full modular style system and living style guide for Stratim's web app.
* Building a lightning-fast series of marketing websites for [Lenovo](https://www.lenovoappexplorer.com/), including a custom content API to enable the marketing website to operate as a static site hosted on a CDN.
* Supporting an engineering team at [Mirror](https://hanno.co/work/mirror/) (a bitcoin startup in San Francisco) in launching their website and web app. We took care of the frontend build for their app, while their in-house team built an API and worked on the business logic behind the scenes, which we integrated with.
* Building our own micro-products and backend services to improve work at Hanno. Such as [Oskar](http://oskar.hanno.co/) (a node-based Slackbot which we've open-sourced) to improve cohesiveness and openness on our remote team.
* Planning, managing and building fully-functional products and startups like [PingPong](https://hellopingpong.com/), a Python-based app for scheduling and running user research and interviews.

## Who works on Engineering at Hanno?

Right now, our core engineering team consists of the following people:

* [Marcel](http://hanno.co/team/marcel): the most JavaScript-focused team member, is capable of writing HTML/CSS, node.js and React Native apps, also worked with PHP and Java in the past
* [Jon](https://hanno.co/team/jon/) is familiar with front-end technology, frameworks such as Bootstrap and Foundation, and is the person on the team that handles all the Ruby-related tasks (although we’re doing our best to remove Ruby from our Stack)
* [Sergei](https://hanno.co/team/sergei/) is a very experienced designer who’s comfortable with all things HTML/CSS and can write a little JavaScript here and there to implement nice animations

Depending on the scope and budget of the project, we also work with external specialists on projects. That's often the case when we work on an existing app which uses a specific technology or framework, but also applies when we work on larger projects and need a bigger team to get the job done on time.

We’re very careful when hiring external developers and have a solid process to try and guarantee that they’re a good cultural fit and will benefit the project.

Usually, the responsibility for finding and selecting the right person is ours, but we’re happy to work with contractors that the client brings into the project as well, as long as there’s a good fit, culturally and with our processes.
