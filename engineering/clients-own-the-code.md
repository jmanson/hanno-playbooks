# Clients own the code

_Ownership principles for code and services used on client projects._

Code ownership is a big deal for us. When a sprint ends, it’s crucial that everything we’ve done is owned by the client, and can be used by them going forwards. This means that whenever we use a third-party service (like [GitHub](http://github.com), [Heroku](http://heroku.com/), etc), we set up the project in an account under the client’s name, not on one of our existing internal accounts.

When working on GitHub, we strongly push for the repository to be hosted on the client’s own GitHub account. not our own. By the time the sprint ends, the idea is to seamlessly transition the project across to the client’s own team to manage and maintain on a daily basis.

After the week’s invoice has been paid in full, all code produced in that week is considered to be owned by the client.
