# Don't reinvent the wheel

_With technology getting more and more powerful over time, why invest time building from scratch?_

At Hanno, we’re big fans of the [lean approach](https://leanvalidation.hanno.co/). And that also applies to our engineering work.

That’s why we employ things like boilerplates and third-party plugins wherever we can (as long as we feel they’re robust) to speed up our development process.

Here's an example:

Many web apps nowadays need a store with an integrated back-office system to manage orders, stock, invoices etc. While doing this from scratch sounds like an interesting challenge, it’s like reinventing the wheel. And it not only costs you time and money, but also a lot of nerves along the way.

A common solution here would be to build your shop with a pre-built solution (e.g. Shopify or Eventbrite) as it already provides all of these features out of the box. You may have a bit less flexibility when it comes to customising things like the check-out process or styling, but the development time you save by not building your own solution is invaluable.

_That’s why we usually advocate for ready built solutions where possible: they might not be 100% customizable, but at least they allow us to validate an early-stage idea and product. The success of a product is more important than a losing sleep over an invoice template and those development hours can be spent on more productive tasks._
